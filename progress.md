# Progress: Status & Remaining Work

## What Works
- **COMPLETED**: Cutting-edge, modern UI with glassmorphism design, advanced animations, and enhanced UX
- Core multi-agent system (Sensor, Analyzer, Remediator, Communicator) is production-ready
- Real-time system monitoring, GPT-powered analysis, automated remediation, and comprehensive logging
- Web dashboard and CLI interface are fully functional with modern design
- Fault tolerance, agent recovery, and fallback logic are validated
- Documentation and onboarding are up to date
- Database persistence module (SQLite) implemented for historical metrics, analysis, remediation
- All agents integrated with database persistence for metrics, analysis, remediation, and system summaries
- RemediatorAgent now includes: browser cache cleanup, user process restart, Windows temp cleanup, DNS cache flush, and config toggles for each action
- Plugin/extensions system scaffolded: plugins/ directory, BasePlugin interface, config-driven loading, plugin loader, and documentation
- Sample plugin (SampleRemediationPlugin) created, registered, and enabled by default; adds custom remediation action (clear Windows event logs)

## What's Left to Build
- Alert integrations (Slack, email, etc.)
- Document plugin API and extension points
- Ongoing documentation and memory bank updates

## Current Status
- **UI MODERNIZATION COMPLETE**: Web interface now features cutting-edge design with glassmorphism, advanced animations, real-time updates, and enhanced UX
- System is stable and ready for enhancement
- Performance and recovery validated in real-world scenarios
- Memory bank initialized and maintained for project continuity

## Known Issues
- Disk space on C:\ is nearly full (remediation recommended)
- OpenAI API quota exceeded during some tests (fallback logic works)
- Service/process monitoring is Windows-only
- Some remediation actions require admin rights
- Ollama connection issues (fallback to GPT API works)
