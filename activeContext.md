# Active Context: Current Focus & Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
- All agents (Sensor, Analyzer, Remediator, Communicator) now integrated with database persistence (SQLite) for metrics, analysis, remediation, and system summaries
- Robust error handling and config-driven toggling for persistence
- RemediatorAgent now includes: browser cache cleanup, user process restart, Windows temp cleanup, DNS cache flush, and config toggles for each action
- All remediation actions are robustly logged, error-handled, and auditable
- Next: Focus on alert integrations and plugin/extensions system
- Plugin/extensions system scaffolded: plugins/ directory, BasePlugin interface, config-driven loading, plugin loader, and documentation

## Recent Changes
- Completed core multi-agent system (Sensor, Analyzer, Remediator, Communicator)
- Implemented web and CLI interfaces
- Validated GPT integration and fallback logic
- Simulated agent failure and confirmed orchestrator recovery
- Performed performance testing and documented results
- Improved documentation (README, troubleshooting, deployment)
- Initialized memory bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md)
- Implemented database persistence module (SQLite, async, config-driven)
- Added config options: persistence_enabled, db_path
- Integrated PersistenceManager with all agents for async DB logging of key events
- Expanded RemediatorAgent with new safe remediation actions (browser cache, user process restart, temp cleanup, DNS flush)
- Scaffolded plugin system: plugins/ directory, BasePlugin interface, plugin loader, config integration, and documentation
- Created and registered sample plugin (SampleRemediationPlugin) that adds a custom remediation action (clear Windows event logs)

## Next Steps
- Implement alerting integrations (Slack, email) with config options
- Scaffold plugin/extensions system for agents and actions
- Create and test a sample plugin (e.g., custom remediation action)
- Document plugin API and extension points
- Ongoing documentation and memory bank updates

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- All enhancements should be toggleable via config
- Use SQLite for initial persistence, but design for extensibility
- Plugins/extensions require system restart for now (no hot-reload)
- Prioritize safe, auditable remediation actions
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation and memory bank
