# Active Context: Current Focus & Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
- **COMPLETED**: Cutting-edge UI implementation with modern design system, glassmorphism, advanced animations, and enhanced UX
- All agents (Sensor, Analyzer, Remediator, Communicator) are integrated with database persistence (SQLite) for metrics, analysis, remediation, and system summaries
- Robust error handling and config-driven toggling for persistence
- RemediatorAgent includes: browser cache cleanup, user process restart, Windows temp cleanup, DNS cache flush, and config toggles for each action
- All remediation actions are robustly logged, error-handled, and auditable
- Plugin/extensions system scaffolded: plugins/ directory, BasePlugin interface, config-driven loading, plugin loader, and documentation
- Backend endpoints /api/metrics and /api/logs now always return valid, structured data (with fallback if no data)
- Patched backend to log warnings and provide clear error/fallback for missing metrics/logs
- Confirmed server restart is required after backend code changes
- Monitoring UI to ensure metrics/logs display correctly after restart

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR**: Implemented cutting-edge web interface with modern design patterns:
  - Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and transparency
  - Advanced CSS animations and transitions
  - Modern color palette with gradients and shadows
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Enhanced accessibility and keyboard navigation
  - Real-time updates with smooth animations
  - Modern JavaScript with ES6+ features and class-based architecture
  - Improved chart visualizations with ECharts
  - Better UX with hover effects, loading states, and notifications
- Completed core multi-agent system (Sensor, Analyzer, Remediator, Communicator)
- Implemented web and CLI interfaces
- Validated GPT integration and fallback logic
- Simulated agent failure and confirmed orchestrator recovery
- Performed performance testing and documented results
- Improved documentation (README, troubleshooting, deployment)
- Initialized memory bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md)
- Implemented database persistence module (SQLite, async, config-driven)
- Added config options: persistence_enabled, db_path
- Integrated PersistenceManager with all agents for async DB logging of key events
- Expanded RemediatorAgent with new safe remediation actions (browser cache, user process restart, temp cleanup, DNS flush)
- Scaffolded plugin system: plugins/ directory, BasePlugin interface, plugin loader, config integration, and documentation
- Created and registered sample plugin (SampleRemediationPlugin) that adds a custom remediation action (clear Windows event logs)
- Patched /api/metrics to always return cpu/memory keys and no_data flag if empty
- Patched /api/logs to always return at least one log entry or a clear error
- Confirmed server status and restart logic
- Backend is robust to missing data and log format issues

## Next Steps
- **PRIORITY**: Implement alerting integrations (Slack, email) with config options
- Document plugin API and extension points
- Ongoing documentation and memory bank updates
- Monitor UI for correct display of metrics/logs after restart
- Add frontend warnings/messages for fallback/no-data if not already present
- Continue alerting integration (Slack, email) as per plan

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- UI modernization successfully completed with cutting-edge design patterns
- All enhancements should be toggleable via config
- Use SQLite for initial persistence, but design for extensibility
- Plugins/extensions require system restart for now (no hot-reload)
- Prioritize safe, auditable remediation actions
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation and memory bank
- Focus on responsive design, accessibility, and performance for future enhancements
- All backend endpoints must be robust to missing data and log format changes
- Server restart is required after backend code changes
- Prioritize clear user feedback for "no data" states in the UI
- Maintain up-to-date documentation and memory bank
