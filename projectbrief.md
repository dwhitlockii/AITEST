# Project Brief: GPT-Driven Multi-Agent System Monitoring & Self-Healing

## Purpose
To build a production-grade, intelligent, and extensible multi-agent system for real-time system monitoring, automated self-healing, and AI-powered analysis, primarily for Windows environments.

## Core Requirements
- Real-time collection of system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, services, processes)
- Multi-agent architecture: SensorAgent, AnalyzerAgent, RemediatorAgent, CommunicatorAgent
- GPT-powered analysis for anomaly detection, trend analysis, and recommendations
- Automated remediation actions (service restart, disk cleanup, etc.) with safety controls
- Asynchronous message bus for agent communication
- Web dashboard (FastAPI) and CLI interface for monitoring and control
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Extensible for future enhancements (plugins, integrations, distributed monitoring)
- Database persistence (SQLite, extensible) for historical metrics, analysis, remediation

## Goals
- Provide intelligent, context-aware system monitoring and self-healing
- Minimize manual intervention for common system issues
- Deliver actionable insights and clear reasoning for all automated actions
- Ensure fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and robust error recovery
- Offer a beautiful, user-friendly interface (web and CLI)
- Enable easy extension and integration with other tools
- Persist all key events/metrics for audit and analysis (configurable)

## Out of Scope
- Non-Windows service monitoring (initially)
- Deep learning model training (uses GPT API, not custom models)
- Full enterprise-scale distributed deployment (future enhancement)

## Success Criteria
- System runs stably on Windows 10/11
- All agents collaborate and recover from failure
- GPT integration provides actionable, accurate analysis
- Users can monitor and control the system via web and CLI
- Documentation is clear and up to date
