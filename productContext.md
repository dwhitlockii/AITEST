# Product Context: Multi-Agent System Monitoring

## Why This Project Exists
Modern systems require intelligent, proactive monitoring and self-healing to minimize downtime and manual intervention. Traditional monitoring tools rely on static thresholds and lack context-aware reasoning, leading to alert fatigue and missed issues. This project leverages AI (GPT) and a multi-agent architecture to deliver smarter, more adaptive system management.

## Problems Solved
- Detects and explains system anomalies with context, not just raw metrics
- Automates safe remediation actions to resolve common issues (service failures, disk space, etc.)
- Reduces manual troubleshooting and intervention
- Provides clear, actionable insights and recommendations
- Improves system reliability and user confidence
- Supports database persistence for historical data (audit, analysis, extensibility)

## How It Should Work
- Agents continuously monitor, analyze, remediate, and communicate about system health
- The system adapts to changing conditions and learns from patterns
- Users interact via a web dashboard, CLI, or API for real-time status and control
- All actions and decisions are logged with reasoning and traceability

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, beautiful, and informative interfaces (web, CLI)
- Transparent, explainable AI-driven decisions
- Minimal noise: only actionable, relevant alerts
- Fast recovery from common issues
- Easy setup, configuration, and extension
